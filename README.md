# 🛰️ Networking Labs (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains my practical **Cisco Packet Tracer labs** completed as part of my Computer Networks degree.  
Each lab demonstrates my understanding of real-world **routing, switching, and troubleshooting** concepts, with step-by-step documentation, configurations, and verification outputs.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build, configure, and troubleshoot scalable enterprise networks using Cisco devices and routing protocols — while documenting every configuration and validation step.
